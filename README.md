## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple CAN-based interior lighting control system using CANoe. The interior lamps (center lamp, footwell lamp, ambient lamps, and roof lamp) turn on whenever any door is open and turn off when all doors are closed.

## Project Steps
The implementation involves the following key components:
1. **Database Creation** - Defining the CAN messages and signals for door status and lighting control.
2. **Simulation Setup** - Configuring the CANoe simulation environment to test the lighting functionality.
3. **Panel Designing** - Creating a user interface panel in CANoe to visualize and control the door status and lights.
4. **CAPL Scripting** - Writing CAPL scripts to automate the lighting behavior based on door signals.

## Functionality
-  **Lights ON:** When any one door is open.

-  **Lights OFF:** When all doors are closed.

## Notes
This is not a step-by-step guide but a showcase of my ability to develop CAN-based automotive simulations in CANoe.
